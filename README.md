# Alcohol-Impact-on-Student-Grades

Diving deep into the intricate relationship between alcohol consumption and academic performance, our empirical analysis provides valuable insights into the academic trajectories of Portuguese secondary school students. Utilizing a rich dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the study encompasses an array of student demographics, alongside their respective exam scores and alcohol consumption habits. In tandem with the concerns raised by the Portuguese Ministry of Health, our analysis unravels key student-driven factors that notably affect academic scores. Further, the research sheds light on the correlation between alcohol consumption levels and academic outcomes. Importantly, we also identify certain demographic clusters demonstrating pronounced alcohol consumption, paving the way for more informed and targeted intervention strategies. We warmly welcome any insights, suggestions, or feedback, believing in the collective effort to enhance the depth and reach of our research.
